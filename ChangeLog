	callback. Start evaluate cmdprocessor routine from Eval.pm command.
	To be used in Watch.pm  Some changes that meant for previous commit:
	Show changed value on watched expression. Store $dbgr object
	properly in Core. Use Watch struct in DB.pm (meant for last commit)


2011-11-10  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* lib/Devel/Trepan/CmdProcessor/Command/Watch.pm: Watch points
	starting to work. There is still screwy magical behavior of the
	debugger in turning tracing off, and I need to evaluate the inital
	value.

2011-11-10  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* lib/Devel/Trepan/WatchMgr.pm: Add watchpoint manager. Closer to
	having watchpoints working...

2011-11-07  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL: use_relative -> relative_lib and need 0.2 or later

	lib/Devel/Trepan/Interface/User.pm: have_gnu_readline ->
	want_gnu_readline which is more precise. Remove commented code from
	Ruby. Reinstate shbang - I can't live without it.

2011-11-06  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* GNUmakefile, MANIFEST, Makefile, lib/Devel/Trepan/IO/Input.pm,
	lib/Devel/Trepan/Interface/User.pm: Really truly allow
	Term::ReadLine to be optional.

2011-11-04  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* lib/Devel/Trepan/Core.pm, lib/Devel/Trepan/IO/Input.pm: Merge in
	some of Shlomi Fish's code to check ReadLine at run time rather than
	at compile time. Also test for Term::ReadLine::Perl.
