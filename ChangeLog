	To be used in Watch.pm  Some changes that meant for previous commit:
	Show changed value on watched expression. Store $dbgr object
	properly in Core. Use Watch struct in DB.pm (meant for last commit)


2011-11-10  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* lib/Devel/Trepan/CmdProcessor/Command/Watch.pm: Watch points
	starting to work. There is still screwy magical behavior of the
	debugger in turning tracing off, and I need to evaluate the inital
	value.

2011-11-10  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* lib/Devel/Trepan/WatchMgr.pm: Add watchpoint manager. Closer to
	having watchpoints working...
