NAME
    Devel::Trepan -- A new Perl debugger

A modular, testable debugger in the style of the Ruby "Trepanning" debuggers.

SYNOPSIS

From a shell: 

        bash$ trepan.pl [trepan-opts] perl-program [perl-program-opts]

Or for those who prefer the traditional Perlish way:

        bash$ perl -d:Trepan perl-program [perl-program-opts]

Calling the debugger from inside your Perl program using Enbugger (2.012 or greater):

	# This needs to be done once and could even be in some sort of conditional code
        require Enbugger; Enbugger->load_debugger( 'trepan' );

	# work, work, work...
	# Oops! there was an error! Enable the debugger now!
        Enbugger->stop;  # or Enbugger->stop if ... 

INSTALLATION

To install this Devel::Trepan, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	make
	make test
	[sudo] make install
