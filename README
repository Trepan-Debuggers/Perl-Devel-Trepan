NAME
    Devel::Trepan -- A new Perl debugger

SUMMARY
    A modular, testable gdb-like debugger in the style of the Ruby
    trepanning debuggers.

    It supports syntax highlighting via Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved, a
    command completion (and history) via GNU ReadLine via
    Term::ReadLine::Perl or Term::ReadLine::Gnu, and interactive shell
    support via Psh or Devel::REPL.

DESCRIPTION
    From a shell:

        bash$ trepan.pl [trepan-opts] perl-program [perl-program-opts]

    Or for those who prefer the traditional Perlish way:

        bash$ perl -d:Trepan perl-program [perl-program-opts]

    Calling the debugger from inside your Perl program using Joshua ben
    Jore's Enbugger:

            # This needs to be done once and could even be in some sort of 
            # conditional code
            require Enbugger; Enbugger->load_debugger( 'trepan' );

            # work, work, work...
            # Oops! there was an error! Enable the debugger now!
            Enbugger->stop;  # or Enbugger->stop if ...
