NAME
    Devel::Trepan -- A new Perl debugger

SUMMARY
    A modular, testable, gdb-like debugger in the family of the Ruby
    trepanning debuggers.

Features: 
* has extensive online-help, 
* syntax highlighting of Perl code
* context-sensitive command completion
* out-of-process and remote debugging
* interactive shell support
* code disassembly
* gdb syntax
* easy extensibility at several levels
    * command aliases
    * a user-supplied command directory
    * Perl Plugin module such as [Trepan::Devel::Disassemble](https://github.com/rocky/Perl-Devel-Trepan-Disassemble)
* is more modular
* comes with extensive tests
* is not as ugly as _perl5db_

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

DESCRIPTION
    From a shell:

        $ trepan.pl [trepan-opts] perl-program [perl-program-opts]

    Or for those who prefer the traditional Perlish way:

        $ perl -d:Trepan perl-program [perl-program-opts]

    Calling the debugger from inside your Perl program using Joshua ben
    Jore's Enbugger:

            # This needs to be done once and could even be in some sort of 
            # conditional code
            require Enbugger; Enbugger->load_debugger( 'trepan' );

            # Alternatively, to unconditionally load Enbugger and trepan:
            use Enbugger 'trepan';

            # work, work, work...
            # Oops! there was an error! Enable the debugger now!
            Enbugger->stop;  # or Enbugger->stop if ... 

    Or if you just want POSIX-shell-like `set -x` line tracing:

       $ trepan.pl -x -- perl-program [perl-program-opts]

    Inside the debugger tracing is turned on using the command `set
    trace print`.  

    There is extensive help from the `help` command.
