Devel::Trepan -- A new Perl debugger
====================================

A modular, testable debugger in the family of the Ruby ["Trepanning"](https://github.com/rocky/rb-trepanning/wiki) [debuggers](https://github.com/rocky/rb-trepanning/wiki).

It has extensive online-help, supports syntax highlighting via
Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved, command completion and
history via GNU ReadLine via L<Term::ReadLine::Perl> or
Term::ReadLine::Gnu, and interactive shell support via Psh or
Devel::REPL.

SYNOPSIS
--------

From a shell: 

        $ trepan.pl [trepan-opts] perl-program [perl-program-opts]

Or for those who prefer the traditional Perlish way:

        $ perl -d:Trepan perl-program [perl-program-opts]

Calling the debugger from inside your Perl program using Joshua ben
Jore's [Enbugger](http://search.cpan.org/~jjore/Enbugger/):

	# This needs to be done once and could even be in some sort of conditional code
        require Enbugger; Enbugger->load_debugger( 'trepan' );

	# work, work, work...
	# Oops! there was an error! Enable the debugger now!
        Enbugger->stop;  # or Enbugger->stop if ...
