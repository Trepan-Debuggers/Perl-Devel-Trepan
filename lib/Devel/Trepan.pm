=head1 NAME

Devel::Trepan -- A new Perl debugger

=head1 SUMMARY

A modular, testable gdb-like debugger in the style of the Ruby
L<trepanning debuggers|http://github.com/rocky/rb-trepanning/wiki>.

It supports syntax highlighting via
L<Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved>, a command completion (and
history) via GNU ReadLine via L<Term::ReadLine::Perl> or
L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu>, and interactive shell support via L<Psh> or
L<Devel::REPL>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

From a shell: 

    bash$ trepan.pl [trepan-opts] perl-program [perl-program-opts]

Or for those who prefer the traditional Perlish way:

    bash$ perl -d:Trepan perl-program [perl-program-opts]

Calling the debugger from inside your Perl program using Joshua ben
Jore's L<Enbugger>:

 	# This needs to be done once and could even be in some sort of 
        # conditional code
        require Enbugger; Enbugger->load_debugger( 'trepan' );

 	# work, work, work...
 	# Oops! there was an error! Enable the debugger now!
        Enbugger->stop;  # or Enbugger->stop if ...
