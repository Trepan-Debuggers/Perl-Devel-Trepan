Set an action to be done before the line is executed. If line is
'.', set an action on the line about to be executed. The sequence
of steps taken by the debugger is:

1. check for a breakpoint at this line 
2. print the line if necessary (tracing) 
3. do any actions associated with that line 
4. prompt user if at a breakpoint or in single-step 
5. evaluate line 

For example, this will print out \$foo every time line 53 is passed:

Examples:
   ${NAME} 53 print "DB FOUND \$foo\\n"

See also "break", "enable" and "disable".
