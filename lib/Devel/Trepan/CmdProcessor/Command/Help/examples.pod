=head2 Commenting
 # This line does nothing. It is a comment and is useful
 # in debugger command files.
      # any amount of leading space is also ok

=head2 Splitting Commands

The following runs two commands: C<info program> and C<list>

 info program;; list

The following gives a syntax error since C<;;> splits the line and the
simple debugger parse then thinks that the quote (") is not closed.

 print "hi ;;-)\n"

If you have the Devel::Trepan::Shell plugin, you can go into a real
shell and run the above.

=head2 Command Continuation

If you want to continue a command on the next line use C<\> at the end
of the line. For example:

 eval $x = "This is \
 a multi-line string"

The string in variable C<$x> will have a C<\n> before the article "a".
