=head1 Command suffixes which have special meaning

Some commands like C<step>, or C<list> do different things when an
alias to the command ends in a particular suffix like ">". 

Here are a list of commands and the special suffixes:

    command   suffix
    -------   ------
    list       >
    step       +,-,<,>
    next       +,-,<,> 
    quit       !
    kill       !
    eval       ?

See help on the commands listed above for the specific meaning of the suffix.
